# Week 2 – Day 1  
## HTML5 + Semantic Layout

---

## Objective
The objective of Day 1 is to understand the core structure of HTML5 and build a complete blog page using **semantic HTML elements only**, without using CSS or `<div>`-based layouts. The focus is on clean structure, accessibility, and meaningful markup.

---

## Topics Covered

### 1. HTML Fundamentals
- Basic HTML document structure
- Use of `<!DOCTYPE html>`
- Head and body separation
- Metadata usage (`charset`, `viewport`, `title`)
- Common HTML tags such as headings, paragraphs, links, lists, and images

---

### 2. Semantic HTML5
- Understanding the importance of semantic elements
- Proper use of:
  - `<header>`
  - `<nav>`
  - `<main>`
  - `<section>`
  - `<article>`
  - `<aside>`
  - `<footer>`
  - `<figure>` and `<figcaption>`
- Avoiding non-semantic containers like `<div>` for layout
- Structuring a real-world blog page layout

---

### 3. Forms and Media
- Creating HTML forms using:
  - `<form>`
  - `<input>`
  - `<select>`
  - `<button>`
- Applying basic form validation using:
  - `required`
  - input types like `email`
- Embedding media using:
  - `<img>`
  - `<video>`
- Proper use of fallback content for media elements

---

### 4. Accessibility Basics
- Adding `alt` text to images
- Using `<label>` elements for form inputs
- Understanding and using ARIA attributes where necessary
- Improving keyboard navigation awareness
- Importance of semantic HTML for screen readers

---

### 5. Documentation
- Writing clear documentation using Markdown
- Explaining project purpose and learnings
- Maintaining clean and readable project structure

## Key Learnings
- Semantic HTML improves accessibility and SEO
- Clean HTML structure is the foundation of responsive design
- Real-world layouts can be created without CSS initially
- Accessibility should be considered from the beginning
- Proper documentation is an essential development skill

---

## Conclusion
This exercise helped in building a strong foundation in HTML5 by focusing on semantics, structure, and accessibility. The blog layout created in this task can be easily extended with CSS and JavaScript in later stages.
